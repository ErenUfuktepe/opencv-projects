#  OpenCV Projects

Welcome to my OpenCV Projects repository! This is a personal collection of fun and practical computer vision mini-projects 
built using Python, OpenCV, and face_recognition. Each project helped me explore and learn different aspects of OpenCV,
from basic image processing to real-time face and gesture recognition.

---

## Purpose

I created this repo to learn, experiment, and practice with OpenCV and computer vision concepts. 
These projects helped me understand:

- Real-time image processing
- Object and face detection
- Gesture recognition
- Contour analysis
- GUI interaction with OpenCV

## Projects Overview

### [face-detection](./face-detection)
Real-time face, eye, and smile detection using Haar cascade classifiers. 
Includes basic face recognition using `face_recognition`.

---

### [finger-counter](./finger-counter)
Counts the number of fingers held up in front of the webcam using contour and convexity defect analysis.

---

### [paint](./paint)
A virtual drawing app where you can use a colored object as a brush to draw on the screen using your webcam.
