# Face Detection with OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV and Haar cascade classifiers. It captures video from your webcam and highlights detected faces with bounding boxes.

## Why This Project?

This script is part of my ongoing journey to learn and experiment with OpenCV. The goal is to understand how traditional face detection methods (like Haar cascades) work and how they can be applied in real-time applications.

## What It Can Do

-  Detect faces in real-time using your webcam
-  Detect face, eyes and smiles using Haar cascades
-  Recognize known faces using the `face_recognition`

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
