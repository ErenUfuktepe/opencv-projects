# Virtual Paint with OpenCV

This project allows you to draw on the screen using a colored object. It uses OpenCV to detect the object based on its color and tracks its movement to simulate painting in real-time.

## Why This Project?

I created this project to experiment with object tracking, contour detection, and virtual interaction using OpenCV. It’s a great example of how simple image processing techniques can be combined to build an interactive application.

## What It Can Do

- Lets you draw on a virtual canvas based on the object’s movement
- Simulates a virtual paintbrush experience
